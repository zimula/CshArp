OBJECT COLLABORATION: relationship between objects. How they work together. 
DEPENDENCY: an object requires another unrelated object to complete its task. 
	- a good example is the relationship between FOOD and FOODREPOSITORY: 
	- the repository requires food to do the serializing. 
		public class Food{
			public int? FoodId {get; set;}
			public string Name {get; set;}
			public decimal Price {get; set;}
		}
		public class FoodRepository{
			//method to save food object to database.
			public int SaveFoodInDatabase(Food food){
				int result = SaveFoodInDatabase(food);
				return result;
			}
			//method to retrieve food object from database.
			public Food GetFood(){
				Food result = new Food();
				result = GetFoodFromDatabaseById(foodId);
				return result;
			}
		}
	- the FoodRepository class requires a food object to create a FoodRepository object
		- the FoodRepository object is an instance in the database.
