DELIGATES: method whose primary purpose is to call other methods. 
	- makes the code lighter by not having to run all methods at run time. Only those that are 
		required. 
	- Usually declared outside classes: before static void Main(string[] args){}
	- example: 
	
		delegate int MathFunc(int a, int b);
			- a delegate of type int
			- named MathFunc
			- with 2 parameters. 
			- must be instantiated as an object 
				MathFunc mf = new MathFunc("method name");
			- applying on values for testing
				consoloe.writeline(mf(4, 5)); //applies the referenced method to the values.
			- a full example:
				
			namespace delegate1{
				
				delegate int MathFunc(int a, int b);
				
				class Program{
					static void Main(string[] args){
						MathFunc mf = new MathFunc("add")// calls the add method. 
						//applying the delegate
						console.writeline(mf(4,5));
						//calling another mehtod using the same delegate
						mf = new MathFunc("sub");
						console.writeline("mf(4,5));
						
						
						//the methods being called. 
						public static int add(int a, int b){
							return a+b;
						}
						public static int sub(int a, int b){
							return (a>b)? (a-b):(b-a);
						}
					}
				}
