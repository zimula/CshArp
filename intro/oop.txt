OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING: OOP:
CLASSES: a class is a template for objects. 
	- have attributes and methods. 
	- example of a simple car class
		Class Car{
			string color = "red";}
OBJECTS: object are created from classes. 
	- a simple car object from the car class: "new" key word is used. 
		static void Main(string[] arg){
			Car myObj1 = new Car();
			//printing car color
			Console.WriteLine("This car is red" + myObj1.color);//output: Ths car is red
		}
CLASS MEMBERS: fields (variables and constant) and methods (actions/ functions).
	- a simple car class with 2 fields and 1 method
		Class Car{
			publc string color = "red";
			public int maxSpeed = 200;
			public void fullThrottle(){
				Console.WriteLine("The car is going as fast as it can!");
			};
		}
		
CONSTRUCTORS: method used to initialize objects from a class
	- can be used to set initial values. 
	- a simple class with a contructor
	- an example of using a contructor to set the value of a field. 
		Class Car{
			string model;
			
			//contructor
			publc Car(){
				model = "Mini";}
		}
	CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETERS: can take parameters and value assignment at instatiation. 
		Class Car{
			publc string model;
			
			//constructor
			publc Car(string model){
				this.model = model;
			}
		}
	ACCESS MODIFIERS
		PUBLIC: access from all classes. 
		PRIVATE: access only from with the class.
		PROTECTED: from class and child classes
		INTERNAL: only accessible from own assembly. 
		-  a simple example of a class with a private field
			class Car{
				private string id;
			}
			- the id can only be accessed from the class, 
			- to remedy this properties and encapsulation is needed. 
		PROPERTIES: used to control access to hidden/ private data via methods (get and set).
			get: returns a value of the field. 
			set: assigns a value to the field. 
		ENCAPSULATION: hides data from users. 
			- getting access to id from car class. 
					class Car{
						private string id;
						
						public string Id{
							get {return id}
							set {id = value}
						}
					} 
					OR shorten it by 
						class Car{
							publc id {get; set;}
						}
				
INHERITANCE: inherit fields and methods from one class to another. 
	- Derived class (child): the class that inherits.  
	- Base class (parent): the class being inherited from
	- : is used to inherit. 
	- a simple example with car inheriting from vehicle. 
			
			-the parent
		class Vehicle{
			publc string brand = "Ford";
			publc void honk(){
				Console.WriteLine("Tuut, tuut!");
			}
		}
			- the child
		class Car: Vehicle
		{	
			publc string model = "Mustang";
		}
			- testing 
		static void Main(string[] arg){
			Car myCar = new Car();
			//test parent method
			myCar.honk();
			Console.WriteLine(myCar.brand + myCar.model);
		}
		- as can be seen, the car class takes on the attributes of the vehicle class. 
		- inheritance can be blocked using "SEALED" on the parent class.
